# Introduction: ArcGIS QuickCapture 
ArcGIS QuickCapture is a field data collection app that allows users to capture field observations. Users are able to capture the location, photo and obervations or incidents while traveling with a few taps on their mobile devices. Users are able to record GIS data with an intuitive button interface on their devices, which will be sent back to the hosted map in real-time and will be ready to use in ArcGIS for analysis and better decision-making.

## Project Objective 
 The goal of this project is to capture and collect road infrastructure needs throughout Washington Park, ranging from potholes, excessive litter, abandonded houses, and vacant lots to observe the variances between the data that MAPSCorps has collected and 311 Service Requests data primarly in Washington Park to see what assets are lacking in the latter.

## Project Overview
There are two field observations that we are collecting: **Survey Data** and **Location Data**. 

Survey Data contains:
1. Damaged Sidewalk
2. Damaged/Broken Light Poles
3. Missing ADA Tiles
4. Excessive Litter
5. Overgrowth

Location Data contains:
1. Potholes
2. Dead Trees
3. Abandoned Houses 
4. Vacant Lots
5. Vacant Lot Wall Space (Potential Art Murals)
