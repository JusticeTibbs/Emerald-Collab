# 1. Abstract Thesis
**Given the variances between the Road Survey data collected by MAPSCorps and 311 Data Service Requests collected by the city of Chicago, MAPSCorps' data provides a more accurate and up-to-date status on the infrastucture needs in Washington Park that the city is unware of.** 

## 2. Emerald Collab Project Timeline 
Road Condition survey began on September 17th and concluded on October 8th. High-school participants went out to Washington Park every Saturday during the four-week period survey the community area, from 11am to 2pm, mapping any infrastructure needs which were complied in real-time. 

## 3. Research Area
The area that was chosen for this research project was Washington Park on Chicago's South Side as apart of Emerald South Collaberative's nonp-profit grant. The Emerald South Economic Development Collaborative generates community wealth and amplifies local culture through shared pride, power, and investment for Chicago's mid-South Side communities; communities that include Woodlawn, Washington Park, and South Shore. Their mission is to attract and coordinate investment through community convening and collaborative partnerships that increase local ownership and community prosperity.

Washington Park encompasses an area strecthing east-west from South Cottage Grove Avenue to the Dan Ryan Expressway, and north-south from 51st Street to 63rd, encompassing an area total of 1.48 sq mi (3.83 km2) . For this project, the park was omitted from our research area, only going east-west from S Martin Luther King Dr to the Dan Ryan Expressway, and decreasing the total area coverage to 0.90 sq mi (2.33 km2). Addionally, an area north of Washington Park's boundary was chosen as well for this research, streching east-west from S Martin Luther King Dr to S Federal St, and north-south  from E 47 St to E 51 St.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1 Participants and Procedure 
Our participants consisted a total of 22 high-school students and 3 Field Coordinators from MAPSCorps to help with data collection with Emerald. The students all came from three schools: Kenwood Academy High School, Hyde Park Academy High School, and the University of Chicago Charter School: Woodlawn Campus. The attendence varied each Saturday; however, on average, 12 high school students showed up in attendence.

The road condition surveys consisted of students utilizing ArcGIS QuickCapture, a field collection app that allows users to capture and record field observations with a simple button interface on their smartphones. We chose QuickCapture due to it being easy-to-use and requiring little training.

When out mapping, the students were split up into 2-3 groups and were assingned to different locations around Washington Park with a Field Coordiantor leading them. The group stucture had the Field Coordinator - the adult- focusing on Potholes and art murals while the students were split up on each side of the street to cover any observations that needed to be capture. Students were required to always wear their MAPSCorps T-shirts when out mapping and to not go into areas that felt unsafe. Students were also given 1-Day Ventra tickets, which are valid on all CTA trains and buses, to travel to Washington Park.
